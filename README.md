## Introduction

It is a [PHP](http://php.net) based module which uses [Silverstripe](http://www.silverstripe.org) as a framework.

It allows a developer to easily create one or more [Calendar](/code/Calendar.php) to display on the same page and with different [Views](#views) ([Day](/code/views/CalendarDayView.php), [Week](/code/views/CalendarWeekView.php), [Month](/code/views/CalendarMonthView.php), [Year](/code/views/CalendarYearView.php)) with the ability to switch from one [Calendar](/code/Calendar.php) and/or [View](#views) to a different [Calendar](/code/Calendar.php) and/or [View](#views).
It also allows a developer to include data such as **events** in the calendar.

## Requirements

* Silverstripe 3

## Overview

### Views

* [Day](/code/views/CalendarDayView.php) (Display a day split vertically by time periods)
* [Week](/code/views/CalendarWeekView.php) (Display a week split vertically by time periods and horizontally by day of the week)
* [Month](/code/views/CalendarMonthView.php) (Display a month split vertically by week and horizontally by day of the week)
* [Year](/code/views/CalendarYearView.php) (Display a year split in 12 [Month](/code/views/CalendarMonthView.php) views)

To use them, they need to be instantiated in the [PHP code](#basic-usage) with a **required name field** and be added to a [Calendar](/code/Calendar.php) object.

### Navigation Bar

It allows the user to go to the next or previous *day|week|month|year* of the current calendar view and is automatically generated by the calendar it is attached to.

See the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) to know how to generate it.

### View Bar

It allows the user to switch between the different [views](#views) attached to calendar is automatically generated by it.

See the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) to know how to generate it.

## Basic Usage

```php
class Page_Controller extends ContentController {
	
	protected $Calendar;

	function init() {
		parent::init();

		$view1 = new CalendarMonthView('month');
		$view1->startBySunday();
		$view1->showWeekLeft();

		$this->Calendar = new Calendar($this, 'calendar', $view1);

		$view2 = new CalendarDayView('day');

		$this->Calendar->addViews($view2);

		$view1->linkDayTo($view2);
	}
}
```

```html
<!-- template Page.ss -->
$Calendar.NavigationBar
$Calendar.ViewBar
$Calendar
<!-- end template Page.ss -->
```
